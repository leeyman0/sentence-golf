    <h1 id="page-title">Sentence Golf!</h1>
    <p>
      Sentence golf is a lot like normal golf, except the players use words
      instead of clubs, and the holes to drive and putt are in the mind of the
      judges.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got this idea from my reoccurring fascination of code golf and applying
      it to communication in general. A blog post is in the works for further
      discussion.
    </p>
    <h2 class="body-heading">The Sport</h2>
    <p>Play of this sport needs four things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A group of players to compete against one another</li>
      <li>One or more impartial judges</li>
      <li>The golf scoring program that can be found on this webpage below</li>
      <li>
        A set of communication goals that the players will try to fulfill in the
        course of play and that the judges will evaluate
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      First, each player on their own will try to fill all communication goals
      within the amount of time allotted by the judges. The judges of that game
      control what resources the players use during the game. It is recommended
      that players have access to the golf scoring program to check their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The golf program grades each word of the text that the players use to
      achieve their communication goals by how frequent it is within the English
      language. The score of each word will range from 1 to 6. The more frequent
      the word is, the less it will score. If a word is not found in the dataset
      at all, a ten-point penalty plus a point for every letter in the word is
      incurred. The scores of all the words are combined to get the final score
      of the sentence or passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judges evaluate how well each of the players did at each of the
      communication goals, considering factors such as clarity and how well the
      point is made. Using this evaluation and conferring amongst themselves,
      the judges will decide on each communication goal to give the player -10,
      0, or +100 to the players' score.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the judges add up all of the points, the player with the least
      points wins the competition.
